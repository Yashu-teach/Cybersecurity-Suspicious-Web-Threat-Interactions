# Cybersecurity-Suspicious-Web-Threat-Interactions
## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing suspicious web traffic data collected from AWS CloudWatch.
The main goal is to detect anomalous and malicious web interactions using data analytics and
machine learning techniques.

Detecting such threats helps organizations protect cloud-based infrastructure from cyber attacks
by identifying abnormal web behavior automatically.
